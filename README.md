Senior Design Team 8!

Smart Parking Project:
Active RFID with Backup openCV system.
Webpage with cloud database intigration.

Where we stand now:
  Still working on object tracking (velocity tracking) to determine car incoming vs. outgoing.
  Waiting on PCB design and Camera purchase (through school) to intigrate and test. 
  Once PCB is delivered, RFID reader and tag will be intigrated with database.
